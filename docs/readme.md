Linear Algebra Accelerator
==========================

**Overview:** The *Linear Algebra Accelerator* project (LAA) is an open-source project, whose name is a bit of a misnomer. Rather than implementing a true/pure accelerator for linear algebra, this project implements a soft-core 32-bit processor using the RISC-V ISA and, most importantly, the experimental RISC-V vector extension (RVV). 

This is a capstone project by 4 senior CS students at the University of Kansas in Lawrence.
